# Who are these docs for?

This documentation is meant to guide folks who have launched and are managing a Forem community.

:::important

NOTE: this guide does not offer development guidance for setting up a Forem. For those who have yet to install the app that are hoping to self-host, please check out our [Forem Selfhost Installation Documentation](https://github.com/forem/selfhost-devel). If you would like to contribute to Forem as a developer, please read our [Forem Developer Documentation](https://docs.forem.com/).

:::

Using these docs, you'll learn:

- how to customize the appearance of your Forem
- how to use moderation tools to keep your community healthy
- how to wield a variety of other features to enhance the experience on your Forem

If you are setting up your Forem for the first time, we recommend reading the Getting Started section first.

If you have joined on with an established Forem as an admin, you may want to skip ahead to the Forem Basics section.
