We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

:::

You can submit bug reports to us directly through GitHub using our [bug report issue form](https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md).

If you have any ideas for features, we ask that you please create a post on [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) detailing your idea for the feature and then tag your post with [#features](https://forem.dev/t/features). This way both the Forem team and community can weigh in openly.
