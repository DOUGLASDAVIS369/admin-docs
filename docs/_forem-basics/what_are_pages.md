# What are Pages?

**Pages** are a way to store static content on your Forem that won't appear in Feeds. They allow for custom formating [compared to Posts](/docs/_forem-basics/what_are_posts) and can be assigned top level paths.

## Overview

The `/admin/customization/pages` page allows you to:

- Create a new page
- View existing pages

- **Title** = The name of the page, appears in the browser window or tab.
- **Slug** = The unique page path that this page will be accessed with, e.g. `https://yourforem.tld/slug`. The slug for `https://dev.to/code-of-conduct` is `code-of-conduct`
- **Description** = A description of what the page contains, used mostly by search engines
- **Template** =
