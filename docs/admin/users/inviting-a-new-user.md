# Invite a New User

In the early stages of setting up your forem, you may want to invite in members before going fully public.

### Inviting a new user \(before the forem is launched\)

* Ensure you are logged in as a superadmin.
* Navigate to `/admin/invitations/new`
  * This can also be reached via `/admin/users`, and then clicking Invitations &gt; New
* Enter recipient Name + Email, they will receive an invitation email where they can accept the invitation
* They will land on a sign-up page where they will **currently** need to perform a "Forgot Password" request for the email associated with the account
* After reseting password, they will be able to sign in
  * In the future this process will be smoothed out
