# Profile Settings

:::important

We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

:::

If a user is a member of multiple Forems, they can have entirely different settings for each one. As an Admin, you may experience users who are unaccustomed to this, so it's handy for you to know what falls under their Settings compared to your Forem Admin configuration.

## User

Contains the required information for every user.
All users must have a profile image. If a user doesnâ€™t upload a profile image, they will be automatically assigned a Gravatar.

## Basic

Optional user information.

## Branding

Users can make changes to the appearance of their profile.

## Coding

This is a DEV legacy section that may disappear from future versions of Forem.

## Work

Another DEV legacy section that has broader application.
