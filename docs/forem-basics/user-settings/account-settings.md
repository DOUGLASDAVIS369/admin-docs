# Account Settings

## Set new password

If your Forem is configured for OAuth and users created their accounts using social account authentication, they have the option to additionally enable email log in.

Note: email log in is in addition to social log in rather than a replacement for it, so all user accounts created via social authorization will continue to require a social account to be connected to them.

## Account emails

Users can have multiple email addresses, for instance, the email address(es) for any connected social log in(s).

## API Keys

The API is still in its beta stage, and users can experiment with person API keys. The [API documentation](https://docs.forem.com/api) contains further information.

## Export content

Currently we only support the export of posts and comments. Users can request them by email.

## Danger Zone

Users can choose to delete their own accounts. Self-deletion will:

- Delete their profile, along with any authentication associations. This does not include applications permissions, which need to be deleted from the apps themselves.
- Delete any and all content saved to the account, such as articles, comments, reading lists, or chat messages.
- Allow their username to become available to anyone.
