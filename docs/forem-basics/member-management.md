# Member Management Pages

Every registered member of a Forem has their own Member Management page, which Admins can use to monitor activity and assign actions to the member's account. It can be accessed for each member by navigating to `/admin/users/<id>` or by navigating to the **People** section of the admin panel and selecting a user. 

![Member Management page](https://forem.dev/images/4CEpHB7I5XQxOSoT5wszxa8ptJtbx9Hv6ZbGMmtT57I/w:880/mb:500000/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9mb3Jl/bS5kZXYvcmVtb3Rl/aW1hZ2VzL3VwbG9h/ZHMvYXJ0aWNsZXMv/MmZhNmQzbTcwc2h1/ZW9yN245Y2gucG5n)

The top of the page displays the most important information about your members such as their [status](https://admin.forem.com/docs/forem-basics/user-roles), contact information, social accounts, and important dates.

## Overflow Menu

Clicking on the overflow menu icon (the vertical three dots) allows Admins to take administrative actions on the members's account such as exporting their data, [unpublishing their posts](https://admin.forem.com/docs/managing-your-community/managing-posts-and-comments), or [banishing them](https://admin.forem.com/docs/managing-your-community/removing-spam).

## Tabs 

Tabs cover the key information about the member's account, their activity, and their interactions with other users on the site. Click on each tab to display additional tools and functions.

**Reports**: any reports submitted by the user.

**Flags**: any flags about the user [submitted by a moderator](https://admin.forem.com/docs/managing-your-community/trusted-user-features)
