# Generated Pages

**Generated Pages** are pages that are created for your when your Forem is created and spun up for the first time.

:::important

If you're looking for information about a custom page, please visit our [Pages documentation](/docs/forem-basics/pages).

:::

## Overview

Here's a high-level list of the pages you'll receive once your Forem is created.

- `/about`
- `/code-of-conduct`
- `/community-moderation`
- `/contact`
- `/events`
- `/faq`
- `/listings`
- `/pod`
- `/privacy`
- `/readinglist`
- `/sponsors`
- `/tag-moderation`
- `/terms`

## Overriding a Generated Page

Certain pages can be overridden to display a custom page built by yourself or team. A great example of this would be the `/contact` page example.

:::note

Only certain pages are able to be be overridden. These pages are:

- `/about`
- `/about-listings`
- `/contact`
- `/community-moderation`
- `/faq`
- `/tag-moderation`

- `/contact` has unique status, in that it's an automatically generated and populated page (which comes with its own [Navigation Link](https://admin.forem.com/docs/advanced-customization/navigation-links) configured) that can be overridden by being created in the Page
