We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

Sidebar tags are a feature that allows admin to specify which tags are displayed in the right-hand sidebar of your homepage. You can also choose in which order these tags are displayed.
