# Campaigns

## Overview

Campaigns (accessed from `/admin/customization/config`) are a way to highlight information to your audience. You can use campaigns in whatever way suits your needs; most often at [DEV](https://dev.to/), we use them to highlight community celebrations or other call-to-actions.

Campaign features include:

1. Large banner on homepage
2. Highlighted articles under a certain tag on homepage righthand sidebar
3. Righthand sidebar image for campaign

You can choose to enable each feature individually or at the same time.
