# Mascot

### About

The Site Mascot is a proxy user that allows [Admins and Moderators](https://admin.forem.com/docs/forem-basics/user-roles) to perform specific functions anonymously. Some of these functions include leaving Moderator Comments and sending Welcome notifications.

Additionally, when content trips the [Spam Trigger Terms](https://admin.forem.com/docs/advanced-customization/rate-limits-and-anti-spam#spam-trigger-terms), it is flagged in the Moderation Portal by the Mascot User. (A user's trustworthiness score is impacted in the same way by an auto-reactions from the Mascot User as it is by the same reaction from a Trusted User](https://admin.forem.com/docs/managing-your-community/trusted-user-features)

### Mascot User ID

Although your Forem comes with a Mascot account, you can change this to any existing user. This gives you the option to create an entirely new Mascot account that matches the style of your own Forem, complete with its own [User Profile](https://admin.forem.com/docs/forem-basics/user-settings/profile-settings).

### Mascot Image URL

If you're keeping the default Mascot User, you can upload a profile image for your Mascot here.
