# Mascot

### About

The Site Mascot is a proxy user that allows [Admins and Moderators](https://admin.forem.com/docs/forem-basics/user-roles) to perform specific functions anonymously. Some of these functions include leaving Moderator Comments, sending Welcome notifications (these show up in an existing users' notifications, inviting them to welcome a new user who has commented for the first time).

Additionally, when content trips the [Spam Trigger Terms](https://admin.forem.com/docs/advanced-customization/rate-limits-and-anti-spam#spam-trigger-terms), it is flagged in the Moderation Portal by the Mascot User. (A user's trustworthiness score is impacted in the same way by an auto-reactions from the Mascot User as it is by the same reaction from a Trusted User](https://admin.forem.com/docs/managing-your-community/trusted-user-features)

### Mascot User ID

Although your Forem comes with a Mascot account, you can change this to any existing user. This gives you the option to create an entirely new Mascot account that matches the style of your own Forem.
