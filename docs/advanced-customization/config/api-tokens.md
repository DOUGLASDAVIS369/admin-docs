We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

## Health Check Token

This health checkup token is used to enable a secure endpoint for monitoring the status of the app \(whether the app is up or down, the status of services like the database, etc\).

## Video Encoder Key

This is a secret key used to allow AWS to perform video encoding through the VideoStatesController. Currently, Videos is not available on most forems.
