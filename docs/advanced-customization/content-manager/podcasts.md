# Podcasts

### Overview

Every Forem comes configured to stream podcasts from a variety of feed sources. Available podcasts are listed on `/pod`. If a user follows a podcast, they will see an item in their feed that updates when new episodes are published.

When a podcast is played on platform, a player will appear at the bottom of the screen and the user is free to browse your Forem as they listen.

### How To Add A Podcast

In order to add a podcast, navigate to `/pod` and click **Suggest a Podcast** at the end of the list of available podcasts (depending on how many podcast your Forem hosts, you may need to scroll), or navigate directly to `/podcasts`.

The **Suggest a Podcast** form contains the following fields:

* **I am the owner of this podcast:** check this box to confirm ownership of (and the right to publish) this podcast

* **Description:** brief description of the podcast that appears beneath the title on the podcast's homepage

This can't be an address that already exists (e.g. a username or organization name that is already in use) and we recommend lower case only as there have been issues with UPPER CASE characters in the past. (required)
* **Main color hex:**  color theme for your podcast page 
* **Image:** square image of your podcast album cover (required)
* **Pattern image:** horizontal image of the banner that appears on your podcast page (this is not required, but certain colour combinations of Main color hex will render the podcast title text unreadable, so we recommend uploading a suitably contrasting **Pattern image**)

* **Overcast URL:** Overcast URL
* **Soundcloud URL:** Soundcloud URL
