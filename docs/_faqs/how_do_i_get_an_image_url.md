# How do I upload an image to get its direct image URL?

You can go to `admin/advanced/tools` in your Forem Admin Portal to upload an image and grab its URL for use elsewhere on your Forem.

![Find the Image Upload tool toward the bottom of your Tools page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forem/admin-docs/main/static/img/imageUploader.png)

Your image URL will look something like this: `dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/alk5808pwnt3j8sb8th3.png`
