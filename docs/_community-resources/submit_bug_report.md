# How can I submit a bug report?

You can submit bug reports to us directly through GitHub using our [bug report issue form](https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md).

If you have any ideas for features, we ask that you please create a post on [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) detailing your idea for the feature and then tag your post with [#features](https://forem.dev/t/features). This way both the Forem team and community can weigh in openly.
