# Frequently Asked Questions

:::important

We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

Who are these docs for?
</summary>

This documentation is meant to guide folks who have launched and are managing a Forem community.

:::important

NOTE: this guide does not offer development guidance for setting up a Forem. For those who have yet to install the app that are hoping to self-host, please check out our [Forem Selfhost Installation Documentation](https://github.com/forem/selfhost-devel). If you would like to contribute to Forem as a developer, please read our [Forem Developer Documentation](https://docs.forem.com/).

Using these docs, you'll learn:

- how to customize the appearance of your Forem
- how to use moderation tools to keep your community healthy
- how to wield a variety of other features to enhance the experience on your Forem

If you are setting up your Forem for the first time, we recommend reading the Getting Started section first.

If you have joined on with an established Forem as an admin, you may want to skip ahead to the Forem Basics section.

What data does Forem collect?
</summary>

We collect and aggregate data about how Forem is being used so that we can focus product development efforts where creators and users are finding the most value, facilitate the delivery of the product, measure engagement and resource consumption, and assess the ongoing health of our infrastructure. The data is generally aggregated but may include identifiers such as Forem Cloud instances.

Please find below a current exhaustive list of the endpoints that comprise our telemetry data sources.
