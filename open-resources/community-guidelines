# Community Guidelines

You made it! We are delighted to welcome you to the forem.dev community, where you will be able to connect with other Forem Creators to discuss all things related to using Forem and building your community.

We've been working hard to make this a space where you can be curious, humble, and wise. Community builders are *our* people, and we want to help you succeed in growing healthy, sustainable communities. ðŸ™Œ

We encourage you to share information by both asking **and** answering questions whenever you can! Here are some of our favorite suggestions for how to do this effectively:

## Ask questions
Asking questions is a really effective way to learn - especially if you can get (or figure out) the answers! 

- Before you ask your question, try dropping some keywords into the search bar to see if anyone has asked it before. _You'll get an answer quicker if it already exists than if you have to wait for someone to see your new question!_
- Make your question the title of your post. If you are having trouble removing a spammy user, then a good title for your post is "How can I remove a spammy user?". Simple is better!
- Share context in the post, such as what the situation is, what you've tried, what has worked/not worked, what error messages you're seeing. 

```
If you have logs, please share them in a code block so they're easier to parse.
```

- Tag your post with `#help` (in the example above, `#moderation` or `#spam` are also appropriate tags).
- Try to be as responsive as possible to people who are replying to your question. They may request additional information to help answer you, so please be patient if they do.
- Please confirm in the discussion below your post if your question has been answered. _For bonus points, reply to the most helpful answer you received to help out people looking for it in the future._

## Answer questions
If you've successfully set up and started growing your Forem community: congrats! We would love to see you supporting and helping others in this community. 

- Believe in your own knowledge! If you have run into the same issue and figured out how to resolve it, please feel empowered to share what you did _and how you figured it out!_
- Try to empathize with the person asking the question. We all benefit from kind, thoughtful communication, _often most of all when we're being vulnerable by asking for help._
- If your answer to the question is longer than 3-4 paragraphs, consider writing a post with your answer and sharing a link to it in the comments below the question. _This will help people looking for it in future._
- If you think the question has been answered before, please share a link to the relevant post _and the answer in the comments, if appropriate._
- If you got stuck trying to figure something out and learned from the experience, please consider writing a post about it to proactively share the knowledge with others who might find it helpful.

And finally...

## Assume the best of each other
Community builders are coming here to ask questions when they're frustrated, tired, or even scared. Communities are wonderful, even magical places, but they can also be full of people's emotions and opinions. 

**Sometimes being helpful is as simple as being kind.** Try not to take it personally if you get an unexpected response from another member, although we encourage you to [report **anything** that makes you feel uncomfortable](https://forem.dev/report-abuse).
