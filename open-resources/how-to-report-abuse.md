## How to report inappropriate content in *Your Forem Name* community

If you have any reason to believe that a user is abusing their posting or commenting privileges to share inappropriate content, whether that is content that violates the community [Code of Conduct](https://forem.dev/code-of-conduct) or [Terms of Use](https://forem.dev/terms), we encourage you to report this for consideration by our Admin team. 

Whilst you can use the universal [Reporting Form](https://forem.dev/report-abuse) to report any URL, we also have some shortcuts to make it easier for you to report content on the fly:

- From the Reactions Sidebar on any post, you'll see a More button `...` below the Heart ðŸ’œ, Unicorn ðŸ¦„, and Save to Reading List ðŸ”– buttons. Inside this menu, you'll find the Report Abuse button that will take you straight to the [Reporting Form](https://forem.dev/report-abuse) with the Post URL pre-filled:

- Another shortcut is available at the bottom of every Post Discussion:

- Meanwhile, if you'd like to report an inappropriate comment, you can do so from the same More button `...` in the top-right corner of any Comment:

If you're logged into your account, your username will be attached to the report in case an Admin has any questions to ask you. If you're not logged in, your report will be anonymous. If you'd like to make your report anonymously, remember to log out before opening the Report Form.

## What happens when you Report content?

If you were logged in, you will receive an email acknowledging you've reported content. 

Reports appear in the Admin Portal for moderation. Admins can review reports and take any action that they find appropriate in line with the community Code of Conduct and/or Terms of Use. If you submitted a report and feel like timely action hasn't been taken, or disagree with the outcome of the review, please email us at *help@yourforem.name*
